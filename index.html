        <div>I’m Fahad, and my background is a vibrant blend of Mexican and Zanzibari heritage. This unique mix fuels my creativity and perspective on life. I’m passionate about technology, and coding brings me immense joy; I often find myself immersed in programming languages and developing innovative apps. To me, coding is not just a skill but an art form that allows me to express my ideas and solve problems. Outside of coding, I love exploring local cuisines, blending flavors from my roots. My diverse interests and multicultural influences shape my worldview, making my journey an exciting one.</div>

        The culture of Mexico is rich and colorful, characterized by vibrant festivals, traditional music, and diverse cuisines, featuring ingredients like corn, beans, and chili peppers. Mexican culture celebrates family and community, with strong ties to indigenous traditions and Catholic influences. In contrast, Zanzibar boasts a unique blend of African, Arab, and Indian influences, evident in its music, dance, and architecture. The islands are known for their spice trade, reflected in flavorful dishes like biryani and seafood. Both cultures prioritize hospitality, showcasing their warmth and generosity through communal gatherings, storytelling, and celebrations that honor their histories and heritage.</div>

        <div style="width: 40%;"> My love for video games began at a young age when my older brother brought home a dusty console from a garage sale. Intrigued, I watched him play fantastical worlds filled with adventure and challenge. One day, he handed me the controller, and I was instantly hooked. The thrill of defeating a boss or solving a tricky puzzle sparked a passion that grew with each level I completed. I began exploring different genres, from platformers to RPGs, and soon discovered online gaming communities where I connected with fellow enthusiasts. Video games became not just a hobby, but a cherished part of my identity.</div>
